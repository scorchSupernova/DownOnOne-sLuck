# DownOnOne-sLuck


This is actually a game, where you will be given a 4x4 grid. Under each cell of the given grid, there will be hidden two types of states (One is Safe and another one is Unsafe). Now, if you tap on each cell, you will get +1 point (If the state of that cell is safe), also you will lose your life by 1 (If the state of that cell is unsafe). States will be generated randomly after each tap. You will be given 3 lifetimes in total. Basically, it is a game of how much point you can achieve in your 3 lifetimes.
